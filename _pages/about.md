Hi, I'm an engineer and researcher currently living in the Bay Area, CA, USA. My current interests lie in AI and its applications. Last year, I was involved with various hackathon projects related to AI area, such as training a speech model, tuning a LLM with Lora / SFT, building a RAG system, and attending AI coding competition in NeurIPs 2024 Meta Cup. I'm astonished by how much LLM can do and how we human can leverage it for helping our real life problems. 

My current job is at Google as a hardware engineer in Pixel phone team. I design the wireless connectivity modules and ship to productions over the Pixel Pro 6/7/8/9/...
My past career was a research engineer at Facebook Connectivity Lab, Los Angeles, CA from 2016 to 2020. It was a golden time of moonshot research in the big tech companies. I felt very lucky that I'm able to work with many talents in the industry and solve the most challenging problems. Project Aquila the big unmanned ariel vehicle which is right now hanging above the head of Mr. Zuck in Building 21 was a symbolized icon of that time. 

Two important works I've done in that period time: The first thing is the demonstration of E-band (71-86GHz) millimeter wave link for a long-distance backhaul, which we broke a world record at the time back then and nowadays it's been used for satellite feederlink in SpaceX. The second thing is the research of the fundamental theory of mechanical steerable antennas and its implementation. Bart and I had linked the antenna theory with Moire pattern and found out the new approach of designing a noval steerable antennas. It was useful back in the time there are no low-cost commerical phase shifter chips in the market. Most of phased array antennas operates at two degrees of freedom (azimuth and elevation angles) but requiring thousands of phase shifters. Our first electronic phased array cost $500k!!! The intent of MSA design was to reduce the cost of satellite user terminal phased array antenna below $500. Now this doesn't apply since the lauch of SpaceX user terminal during pandemic.

Over many years of experience in research of "non-productable" topics (active metamaterials, Project Aquila, MSA, etc.), I learnt that I might either go for it more in the rest of my life (Quantum Computing maybe next), or really opening up my eyes and see what I can really do for the society at the time being. ChatGPT comes in the winter of 2022 and I was wide eye openings and see my inspirations in it. I still remember I was in the hotel of San Francisco and write up a talking agent at the first day of API release of GPT3.5. The beautifulness of working on AI is it's really a multi-displinary topic, which involves chip design, algorithms, communications, modeling and simulation. Its applications are also so broad and the market demand is so urgent. So I decide to go for the AI related industry or research for the rest of my life. 

In 2023, I initiated an AI agent platform integrated into 5G MEC framework. The idea is to bring the computation closer to the users through MNO's network. 
In 2024, I started to join quite a few hackathon projects. I won three times first or second places in AGI house, Hillsborough. Some miscellaneous projects like building an agent app, or a VR application, where I learnt to be a hacker (though I'm not really enjoyed it on the face, cause I don't really consider myself as a good hands-on person, I do spent a lot of time working on miscellaneous stuff to practice). Two competitions I enjoyed -- 2024 KDD Cup RAG competition which you need to use LLM to retreive the correct information from a large webscraped data source to answer a very tricky questions; and the other is 2024 NeurIPs AI Code competition that one needs to use AI to solve very complex algorithm problems in 10mins. I've also attended Beyond Expo in May 2024 at Macau where I met a few startup founders in China and observed a good energy there.
