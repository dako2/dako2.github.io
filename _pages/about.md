Hi, I'm an engineer and researcher based in the Bay Area, CA, USA. These days, my main interests revolve around AI and its applications. Over the past year, I've participated in several AI-focused hackathons—everything from training a speech model and fine-tuning an LLM, to building a RAG system, and competing in the NeurIPs 2024 Meta Cup AI coding challenge. I'm amazed at the vast capabilities of LLMs and how we, as humans, can harness them to tackle real-world problems.

I'm currently at Google, working as a hardware engineer on the Pixel phone team. I design wireless connectivity modules and ship them for the Pixel Pro 6/7/8/9/… series. Before that, from 2016 to 2020, I was a research engineer at Facebook’s Connectivity Lab in Los Angeles. It was an era of bold, “moonshot” research in big tech, and I feel incredibly lucky to have collaborated with many talents on some of the most challenging problems. One memorable project from that time was Project Aquila—a large unmanned aerial vehicle, which now hangs above Mr. Zuckerberg’s desk in Building 21—a true symbol of that period.

Two major achievements stand out from my time there. First, I helped demonstrate a record-breaking E-band (71–86 GHz) millimeter-wave link for long-distance backhaul. The same technique is now used in SpaceX’s satellite feeder links. Second, I worked on the fundamental theory and implementation of mechanically steerable antennas. Together with Bart, I connected antenna theory to Moiré patterns, discovering a novel way to design steerable antennas—much needed back then when affordable commercial phase shifter chips weren’t available. Phased-array antennas typically require thousands of phase shifters, which cost us $500k for our first prototype! The goal behind MSA was to bring the cost below $500 for a satellite user terminal phased-array antenna. That vision became less critical after SpaceX launched its user terminals during the pandemic.

What's next?

Over the years, I’ve explored “non-productizable” research areas—active metamaterials, Project Aquila, MSA, and more. I realized I could either spend my entire life pursuing these kinds of ambitious projects (Quantum Computing might be next) or look around and see how I can contribute to society right now. When ChatGPT arrived in winter 2022, it was a huge eye-opener for me. I still recall being in a San Francisco hotel, coding a conversational agent on the very day the GPT-3.5 API was released. I love AI precisely because it spans multiple disciplines, e.g. chip design, computations, algorithms, communications, modeling, and simulation. And its real-world applications are so vast, with such immediate market needs, that I decided to devote the rest of my career to AI-related research and industry.

In 2023, I kicked off an AI agent platform integrated into 5G MEC, aiming to bring computation closer to users through MNO networks. 

In 2024, I joined several hackathons, winning first or second place three times at AGI House in Hillsborough. Projects ranged from building agent apps to VR solutions, where I got a taste of true “hacker” culture (though I’ll admit I’m still not fully at home in it—lots of hands-on work, but I do enjoy the learning curve). Two competitions especially stood out: the 2024 KDD Cup on RAG, which required using LLMs to retrieve accurate information from massive web-scraped data, and the 2024 NeurIPs AI Code competition, where we had to solve very complex algorithmic tasks in under 10 minutes. I also made it to Beyond Expo in Macau in May 2024, where I met a few startup founders from China and soaked in the vibrant energy there.

Thanks for visiting my site—it's still a work in progress, so stay tuned for more!
