Hi, I'm an engineer and researcher currently living in the Bay Area, CA, USA. My current interests lie in AI and its applications. Last year, I was involved with various hackathon projects related to AI area, such as training a speech model, tuning a LLM with Lora / SFT, building a RAG system, and attending AI coding competition in NeurIPs 2024 Meta Cup. I'm astonished by how much LLM can do and how we human can leverage it for helping our real life problems. 

My current job is at Google as a hardware engineer in Pixel phone team. I design the wireless connectivity modules and ship to productions over the Pixel Pro 6/7/8/9/...
My past career was a research engineer at Facebook Connectivity Lab, Los Angeles, CA from 2016 to 2020. It was a golden time of moonshot research in the big tech companies. I felt very lucky that I'm able to work with many talents in the industry and solve the most challenging problems. Project Aquila the big unmanned ariel vehicle which is right now hanging above the head of Mr. Zuck in Building 21 was a symbolized icon of that time. 

Two important works I've done in that period time: The first thing is the demonstration of E-band (71-86GHz) millimeter wave link for a long-distance backhaul, which we broke a world record at the time back then and nowadays it's been used for satellite feederlink in SpaceX. The second thing is the research of the fundamental theory of mechanical steerable antennas and its implementation. Bart and I had linked the antenna theory with Moire pattern and found out the new approach of designing a noval steerable antennas. It was useful back in the time there are no low-cost commerical phase shifter chips in the market. Most of phased array antennas operates at two degrees of freedom (azimuth and elevation angles) but requiring thousands of phase shifters. Our first electronic phased array cost $500k!!! The intent of MSA design was to reduce the cost of satellite user terminal phased array antenna below $500. Now this doesn't apply since the lauch of SpaceX user terminal during pandemic.
