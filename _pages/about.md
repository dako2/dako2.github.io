Hi, I'm a researcher and engineer living in the Bay Area, California. These days my interests revolve around AI and its applications. Over the years, I've led several research projects and successfully brought products to market.

Currently, I work at Google on the Pixel phone team, where I design and ship wireless connectivity modules for the Pixel Pro series (including models 6/7/8/9...). Prior to this, from 2016 to 2020, I was a research engineer at Facebook’s Connectivity Lab in Los Angeles.

Two major achievements from my time at Facebook Connectivity Lab stand out: 

- First, I led the development of a record-breaking high throughput long distance E-band (71–86 GHz) millimeter-wave link.

- Second, I connected antenna theory to Moiré patterns, discovering a novel way to design steerable antennas—much needed back then when affordable commercial phase shifter chips weren’t available. Phased-array antennas typically require thousands of phase shifters, which cost us $500k for our first prototype! The goal behind MSA was to bring the cost below $500 for a satellite user terminal phased-array antenna. That vision became less critical after SpaceX launched its user terminals during the pandemic.

What's next?

Over the years, I’ve explored “non-productizable” research areas—active metamaterials, Project Aquila, MSA, and more. I realized I could spend my entire life pursuing these kinds of research topics and really enjoyed it. There are still many works I left unfinished, e.g. the stability control theory in active/gain materials, the bullseye morie patterned steerable array antenna. However, ChatGPT arrived in winter 2022, it was a huge eye-opener for me. I still recall being in a San Francisco hotel, coding a conversational agent on the very day the GPT-3.5 API was released. The impact is so broad and cross-displinary and the market needs is so urge, that I decided to devote the rest of my career to AI-related research and industry.

In 2023, I kicked off an AI agent platform integrated into 5G MEC standard, aiming to bring computation closer to users by MNO's network.

In 2024, I've participated in several AI-related hackathons—everything from training a speech model and fine-tuning an LLM, to building a RAG system and code generation. I'm amazed at the vast capabilities of LLMs and how we, as humans, can harness them to tackle real-world problems.

Two competitions especially stood out: the 2024 KDD Cup on RAG, which required using LLMs to retrieve accurate information from massive web-scraped data, and the 2024 NeurIPs AI Code competition, where we had to solve very complex algorithmic tasks in under 10 minutes. I also made it to Beyond Expo in Macau in May 2024, where I met a few startup founders from China and soaked in the vibrant energy there.

Thanks for visiting my site—it's still a work in progress, so stay tuned for more!
