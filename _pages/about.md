<i>Researcher and Engineer specializing in AI and Wireless Communications</i>

Hi, I'm a researcher and engineer living in the Bay Area, California. These days my interests revolve around AI and its applications. My career spans both industry-leading research and engineering roles, where I have led multiple research initiatives and successfully transitioned innovative projects into market-ready products.

Current Position and Research Interests
---
I currently work at Google, where my responsibilities include the design and deployment of wireless connectivity solutions for Pixel devices. My work involves the development of high-performance connectivity modules, contributing to the enhancement of consumer electronics technology. 

Previous Experience and Key Achievements
---
From 2016 to 2020, I served as a research engineer at Facebook’s Connectivity Lab in Los Angeles. During this period, I collaborated with a multidisciplinary team to address complex challenges in wireless communication and antenna design. One notable project was Project Aquila, a large unmanned aerial vehicle, which served as a platform for pioneering long-distance wireless research.

Two major technical contributions during my tenure at Facebook include:

E-band Millimeter-Wave Link: I led the development of a complex high-throughput, long-distance E-band (71–86 GHz) millimeter-wave communication system, setting a new record in the field.  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/19/facebooks-millimeter-wave-radio-tech-hits-new-bandwidth-records/?fbclid=IwY2xjawHsVZZleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHc3j-WvWnDk_gBAGb6Jh4iBZblvAQhuPNKW3mIO4fLofToCk_mRmDqcRcQ_aem_9djtcKzJWGYHpPtkoHp3Iw" target="_blank">Read more about this achievement on TechCrunch</a> This advancement in high-frequency wireless communication has been applied in SpaceX’s satellite feeder links, demonstrating significant impact on the industry.

Innovative Antenna Design via Moiré Patterns: I integrated principles of antenna theory with Moiré pattern analysis to conceive a novel method for designing steerable antennas. This approach offered a cost-effective alternative to traditional phased-array antenna designs, which typically require thousands of expensive phase shifters. The method aimed to reduce the cost of a satellite user terminal phased-array antenna from approximately $500k to below $500. Although subsequent market developments shifted priorities, the research provided valuable insights into antenna theory and design.

Research Trajectory and Future Directions
--- 
My research interests extend to several areas, including active metamaterials, stability control theory in active/gain materials, and advanced antenna architectures such as bullseye Moiré-patterned steerable array antennas. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and conversational AI, exemplified by the advent of ChatGPT in late 2022, has redirected my focus towards AI-related research. The broad interdisciplinary impact and urgent societal needs associated with AI have motivated me to devote my career to this domain.

Recent Projects and Achievements
---
In 2023, I initiated an AI agent platform integrated into the 5G Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) standard, aiming to decentralize computation and reduce latency by leveraging mobile network operators’ infrastructure.
In 2024, I engaged in various AI-centered hackathons, where I worked on projects ranging from training speech models and fine-tuning LLMs to constructing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and developing code generation tools. These experiences have deepened my understanding of AI capabilities and their applications in solving complex real-world problems.
Notable competitions include the 2024 KDD Cup on RAG, which focused on using LLMs to retrieve accurate information from extensive web-scraped datasets, and the 2024 NeurIPS AI Code competition, where my team addressed highly complex algorithmic challenges under strict time constraints.
