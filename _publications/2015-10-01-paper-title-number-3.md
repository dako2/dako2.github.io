We present a compact, flat-panel phased-array antenna design that beam steers using only mechanical in-plane rotations. We explain the steering mechanism and characterize the beam analytically and numerically. Measurements of two prototype antennas for different frequencies validate the concept and modeling. The prototype designs are described in detail and feature added phase-offset control of the array elements in the aperture layout. Potential applications include low-cost and low-power flat-panel user terminals for the next generation of aerial and space communication systems.
