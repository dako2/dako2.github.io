          <p class="hero-subtitle">Ph.D. Engineer & Researcher</p>
          <p class="hero-location">Google Inc. • U.S.</p>
          <p class="hero-bio">Hi, I was born and raised in Harbin, northeastern China, a city known for its annual winter ice and snow festivals. I came to the states in 2011 to pursue my doctoral degree in applied electromagnetics at the University of Arizona. I stayed in north LA for 5 years as a researcher in the Facebook Connectivity Lab mostly working on drone and satellite projects. During pandemic, I moved to the bay area and joined Google Pixel team as a senior hardware engineer. My current interests lie in AI model research and consumer product development.</p>

        <div class="experience-item">
          <h3>Facebook Connectivity Lab (2016-2020)</h3>
          <p>From 2016 to 2020, I served as a research engineer at Facebook's Connectivity Lab in Los Angeles. During this period, I collaborated with a multidisciplinary team to address complex challenges in wireless communication and antenna design. One notable project was Project Aquila, a large unmanned aerial vehicle, which served as a platform for pioneering long-distance wireless research.</p>

          <h4>Major Technical Contributions:</h4>
          
          <div class="contribution">
            <h5>E-band Millimeter-Wave Link</h5>
            <p>I led the development of a complex high-throughput, long-distance E-band (71–86 GHz) millimeter-wave communication system, setting a new record in the field. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/19/facebooks-millimeter-wave-radio-tech-hits-new-bandwidth-records/?fbclid=IwY2xjawHsVZZleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHc3j-WvWnDk_gBAGb6Jh4iBZblvAQhuPNKW3mIO4fLofToCk_mRmDqcRcQ_aem_9djtcKzJWGYHpPtkoHp3Iw">Read more about this achievement on TechCrunch</a>. This advancement in high-frequency wireless communication has been applied in SpaceX's satellite feeder links, demonstrating significant impact on the industry.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="contribution">
            <h5>Innovative Antenna Design via Moiré Patterns</h5>
            <p>I integrated principles of antenna theory with Moiré pattern analysis to conceive a novel method for designing steerable antennas. This approach offered a cost-effective alternative to traditional phased-array antenna designs, which typically require thousands of expensive phase shifters. The method aimed to reduce the cost of a satellite user terminal phased-array antenna from approximately $500k to below $500. Although subsequent market developments shifted priorities, the research provided valuable insights into antenna theory and design. A minimum viable product was developed. Later in 2020, the research group was acquired by Project Kuiper.</p>

        <div class="research-trajectory">
          <h3>Research Trajectory and Future Directions</h3>
          <p>My research interests extend to several areas, including active metamaterials, stability control theory in active/gain materials, and advanced antenna architectures such as bullseye Moiré-patterned steerable array antennas. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and conversational AI, exemplified by the advent of ChatGPT in late 2022, has redirected my focus towards AI-related research. The broad interdisciplinary impact and urgent societal needs associated with AI have motivated me to devote my career to this domain.</p>
