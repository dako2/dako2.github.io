we know machine signals are using electrical signals to compute and communicate
If machine can think and has the will to communicate, they don't have to convert the signals into human (natural) language

we know natural language is highly compressive way of expression, merely few persons have the real skills of managing accurate expression of thinking 
how the language envolves from a community is the next study 

Cats can communicate with another cats without knowing human languages. If some variants of meow~ can work out through out a cat's life, how we can let a machine to communicate with another machine at an intelligent level of a cat. 

A switch controls the light's on and off. if the switch has an intelligence, he/she might firstly know he's a switch first (he can turn on and off), he knows the consequence he turns on and off makes the light on and off (amibient light)

At least there are ways and logics that human designed we call user interface functions, visual plots, and or acturations 

Then accousitc sound. electromagnetic wave can propagate much faster.
