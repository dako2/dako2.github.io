Metamaterials are artificially designed composite materials which can exhibit unique
and unusual properties such as the negative refractive index, negative phase velocity, etc.
The concept of metamaterials becomes prevalent in the electromagnetic society since the
first experimental implementation in the early 2000s. Many fascinated potential
applications, e.g. super lens, invisibility cloaking, and novel antennas that are electrically
small, have been proposed based on metamaterials. However, most of the applications still
remain in theory and are not suitable for practical applications mainly due to the intrinsic
loss and narrow bandwidth (large dispersion) determined by the fundamental physics of
metamaterials.

In this dissertation, we incorporate active gain devices into conventional passive
metamaterials to overcome loss and even provide gain. Two types of active gain negative
refractive index metamaterials are proposed, designed and experimentally demonstrated,
including an active composite left-/right-handed transmission line and an active volumetric
metamaterial. In addition, we investigate the non-Foster circuits for broadband matching
of electrically small antennas. A rigorous way of analyzing the stability of non-Foster
circuits by normalized determinant function is proposed. We study the practical factors that
may affect the stability of non-Foster circuits, including the device parasitics, DC biasing,
layouts and load impedance. A stable floating negative capacitor is designed, fabricated
and tested. Moreover, it is important to resolve the sign of refractive index for active gain
media which can be quite challenging. We investigate the analytical solution of a gain slab
system, and apply the Nyquist criterion to analyze the stability of a causal gain medium.

We then emphasize that the result of frequency domain simulation has to be treated with
care. Lastly, this dissertation discusses another interesting topic about THz spectroscopy
of live cells. THz spectroscopy becomes an emerging technique for studying the dynamics
and interactions of cells and biomolecules, but many practical challenges still remain in
experimental studies. We present a prototype of simple and inexpensive cell-trapping
microfluidic chip for THz spectroscopic study of live cells. Cells are transported, trapped
and concentrated into the THz exposure region by applying an AC bias signal while the
chip maintains a steady temperature at 37 ÌŠC by resistive heating. We conduct some
preliminary experiments on E. coli and T cell solution and compare the transmission
spectra of empty channels, channels filled with aqueous media only, and channels filled
with aqueous medium with un-concentrated and concentrated cells.
