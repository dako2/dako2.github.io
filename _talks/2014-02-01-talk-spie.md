Microfluidic devices have been widely used in manipulation and analysis of individual cells in small-volume solutions. It could be potentially used for studies of the interaction of THz radiation with biomolecules and cells in aqueous media. We present a prototype microfluidic device that can be used for controlled cellular exposures to THz radiation. The device is made of a PDMS microfluidic channel on glass substrate and consists of electrodes for cell concentration. Initial cell concentration and THz transmission measurements have been performed on various prototype samples. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using microfluidic chips for potential “Lab-on-a-Chip” THz applications.
